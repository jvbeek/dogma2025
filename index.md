I believe that contemporary representational art would benefit from a manifesto akin to Lars Von Trier's Dogma 95. There is an overwhelming amount of pretentious and artificial painting emerging from the neo-academic schools, and much of contemporary art's painting tends to be “paint-by-numbers” derived from digital photographs.

I hereby propose the following manifesto, based on Dogma 95 but adapted to painting:

# Dogma 2025

The Pledge of Chastity:

1. The image must be created on-site. Props and sets must not be introduced (if certain props are required for the narrative, a location must be chosen where the props are already present).
  
2. The format and surface of the image, such as brushstrokes, must not be smoothed, distorted, or cropped in any way after its creation. The integrity of the image must be preserved.
  
3. The image must be produced on-site in front of the subject.
  
4. The image must maintain consistent lighting. If artificial lighting is used, it must be executed under the same lighting conditions. The number of light sources should be minimized.
  
5. The image should be executed in one layer, all prima.
  
6. The image must not contain superficial elements with speculative traits such as paraphrases, quotes, or borrowings.
  
7. The image must be executed in a single session.
  
8. No distinction should be made between subjects; there are no genres.
  
9. The image should be produced using the fewest means possible and with durable materials.
  
10. The working process must be replicable and transparent.

Dogma 2025
This approach is intended to embrace simplicity and observational power, a form of retrogradism in the same spirit as Caravaggio, Ribera, and Francisco de Zurbarán’s restrained seriousness. They rejected the idealizing, allegorically laden excesses of mannerism and returned to simple scenes through direct observation of the subject, without affectation. Voluntarism and independence are some of the cornerstones of Dogma 2025, which is also imbued with transparency and a scientific spirit, where discoveries and methods are freely shared and subjected to peer review. In a time when mechanical processes increasingly encroach upon craft, Dogma 2025 asserts the irreplaceable value of human perception and presence.
In an age where images are increasingly mediated, the distinction between direct experience and abstraction grows ever more pronounced. Painting from life is a first-hand engagement with reality—an act of perception that demands presence, adaptation, and response to shifting conditions. Working from photographic sources introduces a degree of separation, reducing the subject to a static imprint, filtered through mechanical constraints. When those images are further altered by unseen processes, they risk becoming impressions of impressions, twice removed from their origin. Dogma 2025 seeks to reclaim the immediacy of observation, insisting on the primacy of the artist’s eye over intermediaries that reshape the world before it is even seen.
It is difficult to imagine the cinematic history of this century without Lars Von Trier's Dogma 95, the wave of groundbreaking TV series and films that have shaped our contemporary culture. Likewise, as the means of image-making grow ever more detached from physical reality, the need for a manifesto that reclaims direct experience, material integrity, and artistic labor becomes urgent. Dogma 2025 is not nostalgia but a reaffirmation of authorship in an era where effortless replication threatens to undermine the distinctiveness of the artist’s hand. 
As Bondo says in Lars von Trier's The Kingdom: "Videnskaben!"

Dogma 2025: A Manifesto for Painting in the Age of Mediation

In an era where images are increasingly detached from direct human experience, Dogma 2025 stands as a reaffirmation of artistic presence, material integrity, and observational truth. This initiative seeks to create a community and certification process for painters committed to working from life, ensuring that the “human eye, hand, and perception” remain at the heart of representational art.  

The “Dogma 2025 Online Platform” serves as both a registry and a forum for artists who adhere to the principles outlined in the manifesto. Through a transparent review system, artists may submit works accompanied by documentation of their process—establishing a standard of authenticity and reaffirming the irreplaceable value of direct engagement with the world.  

By promoting rigor, independence, and an open exchange of methods, this initiative seeks not to impose restrictions, but to “safeguard painting as a firsthand encounter with reality”. In a time when the origins of images grow increasingly opaque, Dogma 2025 offers a space where works can be recognized for their “truth, presence, and integrity.”
